1
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:18,925
So I want to start by offering you
a free no-tech life hack,

2
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:21,546
and all it requires of you is this:

3
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,733
that you change your posture
for two minutes.

4
00:00:25,757 --> 00:00:29,157
But before I give it away,
I want to ask you to right now

5
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:32,750
do a little audit of your body
and what you're doing with your body.

6
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:35,465
So how many of you are
sort of making yourselves smaller?

7
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:38,810
Maybe you're hunching, crossing your legs,
maybe wrapping your ankles.

8
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:42,549
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this.

9
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:46,220
Sometimes we spread out. (Laughter)

10
00:00:46,244 --> 00:00:48,492
I see you. (Laughter)

11
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:51,507
So I want you to pay attention
to what you're doing right now.

12
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:53,865
We're going to come back
to that in a few minutes,

13
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:56,813
and I'm hoping that if you learn
to tweak this a little bit,

14
00:00:56,837 --> 00:01:00,249
it could significantly change
the way your life unfolds.

15
00:01:00,273 --> 00:01:04,773
So, we're really fascinated
with body language,

16
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:08,696
and we're particularly interested
in other people's body language.

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,917
You know, we're interested in,
like, you know — (Laughter) —

18
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:17,315
an awkward interaction, or a smile,

19
00:01:17,339 --> 00:01:21,547
or a contemptuous glance,
or maybe a very awkward wink,

20
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:24,785
or maybe even something like a handshake.

21
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:28,134
Narrator: Here they are
arriving at Number 10.

22
00:01:28,158 --> 00:01:32,627
This lucky policeman gets to shake hands
with the President of the United States.

23
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:37,554
Here comes the Prime Minister --
No. (Laughter) (Applause)

24
00:01:37,578 --> 00:01:40,229
(Laughter) (Applause)

25
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:43,936
Amy Cuddy: So a handshake,
or the lack of a handshake,

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,460
can have us talking for weeks
and weeks and weeks.

27
00:01:46,484 --> 00:01:48,600
Even the BBC and The New York Times.

28
00:01:48,624 --> 00:01:52,551
So obviously when we think
about nonverbal behavior,

29
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:55,939
or body language -- but we call it
nonverbals as social scientists --

30
00:01:55,963 --> 00:01:58,819
it's language, so we think
about communication.

31
00:01:58,843 --> 00:02:01,846
When we think about communication,
we think about interactions.

32
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,285
So what is your body language
communicating to me?

33
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:06,351
What's mine communicating to you?

34
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:12,323
And there's a lot of reason to believe
that this is a valid way to look at this.

35
00:02:12,347 --> 00:02:14,591
So social scientists
have spent a lot of time

36
00:02:14,615 --> 00:02:16,696
looking at the effects
of our body language,

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,  5
or other people's body language,
on judgments.

38
00:02:19, 29 --> 00:02:22,444
And we make sweeping judgments
and inferences from body language.

39
00:02:22,468 --> 00:02:26,434
And those judgments can predict
really meaningful life outcomes

40
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:30,227
like who we hire or promote,
who we ask out on a date.

41
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:34,912
For example, Nalini Ambady,
a researcher at Tufts University,

42
00:02:34,936 --> 00:02:39,384
shows that when people watch
30-second soundless clips

43
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:42,408
of real physician-patient interactions,

44
00:02:42,432 --> 00:02:45,241
their judgments
of the physician's niceness

45
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,878
predict whether or not
that physician will be sued.

46
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:49,560
So it doesn't have to do so much

47
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:52, 83
with whether or not that physician
was incompetent,

48
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:54,913
but do we like that person
and how they interacted?

49
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:57,848
Even more dramatic,
Alex Todorov at Princeton

50
00:02:57,872 --> 00:03:01,525
has shown us that judgments
of political candidates' faces

51
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,493
in just one second predict 70 percent

52
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:09,343
of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial
race outcomes,

53
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:11,565
and even, let's go digital,

54
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:15,710
emoticons used well in online negotiations

55
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:18,542
can lead to you claim more value
from that negotiation.

56
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:21,765
If you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?

57
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:24,862
So when we think of nonverbals,
we think of how we judge others,

58
00:03:24,886 --> 00:03:27,764
how they judge us
and what the outcomes are.

59
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:29,884
We tend to forget, though,
the other audience

60
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:33,319
that's influenced by our nonverbals,
and that's ourselves.

61
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:36,532
We are also influenced by our nonverbals,

62
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:38,895
our thoughts and our feelings
and our physiology.

63
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,958
So what nonverbals am I talking about?

64
00:03:41,982 --> 00:03:44,901
I'm a social psychologist.
I study prejudice,

65
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,628
and I teach at a competitive
business school,

66
00:03:47,652 --> 00:03:52,112
so it was inevitable that I would become
interested in power dynamics.

67
00:03:52,136 --> 00:03:55,924
I became especially interested
in nonverbal expressions

68
00:03:55,948 --> 00:03:57,927
of power and dominance.

69
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:00,666
And what are nonverbal expressions
of power and dominance?

70
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,749
Well, this is what they are.

71
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:05,627
So in the animal kingdom,
they are about expanding.

72
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:08,637
So you make yourself big, you stretch out,

73
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:11,578
you take up space,
you're basically opening up.

74
00:04:11,602 --> 00:04:13,524
It's about opening up.

75
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:16,279
And this is true
across the animal kingdom.

76
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:18,328
It's not just limited to primates.

77
00:04:19, 64 --> 00:04:21,748
And humans do the same thing. (Laughter)

78
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:25,459
So they do this both when they have
power sort of chronically,

79
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:28,460
and also when they're feeling
powerful in the moment.

80
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:31,532
And this one is especially interesting
because it really shows us

81
00:04:31,556 --> 00:04:35,554
how universal and old these
expressions of power are.

82
00:04:35,578 --> 00:04:38,153
This expression, which is known as pride,

83
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,406
Jessica Tracy has studied.

84
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,313
She shows that people
who are born with sight

85
00:04:43,337 --> 00:04:46,254
and people who are congenitally
blind do this

86
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:48,568
when they win at a physical competition.

87
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:51, 46
So when they cross
the finish line and they've won,

88
00:04:51, 70 --> 00:04:53,547
it doesn't matter if they've never
seen anyone do it.

89
00:04:53,571 --> 00:04:54,864
They do this.

90
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:57,386
So the arms up in the V,
the chin is slightly lifted.

91
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,473
What do we do when we feel powerless?

92
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:01,252
We do exactly the opposite.

93
00:05:01,276 --> 00:05:03,780
We close up.
We wrap ourselves up.

94
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,148
We make ourselves small.

95
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,528
We don't want to bump
into the person next to us.

96
00:05:07,552 --> 00:05:10,285
So again, both animals and humans
do the same thing.

97
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:14,265
And this is what happens
when you put together high and low power.

98
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:17,391
So what we tend to
do when it comes to power

99
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:20, 44
is that we complement
the other's nonverbals.

100
00:05:20, 68 --> 00:05:22,475
So if someone is being
really powerful with us,

101
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:25,119
we tend to make ourselves smaller.
We don't mirror them.

102
00:05:25,143 --> 00:05:26,733
We do the opposite of them.

103
00:05:26,757 --> 00:05:29,932
So I'm watching this behavior
in the classroom,

104
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:32,469
and what do I notice?

105
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:39,722
I notice that MBA students really exhibit
the full range of power nonverbals.

106
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:42,270
So you have people
who are like caricatures of alphas,

107
00:05:42,294 --> 00:05:45,675
really coming into the room, they get
right into the middle of the room

108
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:49,112
before class even starts,
like they really want to occupy space.

109
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:51,375
When they sit down,
they're sort of spread out.

110
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,133
They raise their hands like this.

111
00:05:53,157 --> 00:05:55,768
You have other people
who are virtually collapsing

112
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:58,292
when they come in.
As soon they come in, you see it.

113
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,585
You see it on their faces
and their bodies,

114
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:03,403
and they sit in their chair
and they make themselves tiny,

115
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:05,765
and they go like this
when they raise their hand.

116
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:07,647
I notice a couple of things about this.

117
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:09,481
One, you're not going to be surprised.

118
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:11,523
It seems to be related to gender.

119
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:16,988
So women are much more likely
to do this kind of thing than men.

120
00:06:17, 12 --> 00:06:19,574
Women feel chronically
less powerful than men,

121
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:21,456
so this is not surprising.

122
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,529
But the other thing I noticed

123
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:26,195
is that it also seemed
to be related to the extent

124
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:30, 55
to which the students were participating,
and how well they were participating.

125
00:06:30, 79 --> 00:06:32,637
And this is really important
in the MBA classroom,

126
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:35,318
because participation
counts for half the grade.

127
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:39,791
So business schools have been struggling
with this gender grade gap.

128
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:43, 63
You get these equally qualified
women and men coming in

129
00:06:43, 87 --> 00:06:45,230
and then you get
these differences in grades,

130
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:48,319
and it seems to be partly
attributable to participation.

131
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:51,342
So I started to wonder, you know, okay,

132
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:54,984
so you have these people coming in
like this, and they're participating.

133
00:06:55,  8 --> 00:06:57,537
Is it possible that we could
get people to fake it

134
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:59,561
and would it lead them
to participate more?

135
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:04,174
So my main collaborator
Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley,

136
00:07:04,198 --> 00:07:07,729
and I really wanted to know,
can you fake it till you make it?

137
00:07:07,753 --> 00:07:10,280
Like, can you do this
just for a little while

138
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,956
and actually experience
a behavioral outcome

139
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,682
that makes you seem more powerful?

140
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:18,134
So we know that our nonverbals
govern how other people

141
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:20,539
think and feel about us.
There's a lot of evidence.

142
00:07:20,563 --> 00:07:21,985
But our question really was,

143
00:07:22,  9 --> 00:07:26, 49
do our nonverbals govern
how we think and feel about ourselves?

144
00:07:26, 73 --> 00:07:28,739
There's some evidence that they do.

145
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:33,375
So, for example, we smile
when we feel happy,

146
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,553
but also, when we're forced to smile

147
00:07:35,577 --> 00:07:39,968
by holding a pen in our teeth
like this, it makes us feel happy.

148
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,910
So it goes both ways.

149
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:45,716
When it comes to power,
it also goes both ways.

150
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,264
So when you feel powerful,

151
00:07:48,288 --> 00:07:50, 59
you're more likely to do this,

152
00:07:50, 83 --> 00:07:56,261
but it's also possible
that when you pretend to be powerful,

153
00:07:56,285 --> 00:07:59,684
you are more likely
to actually feel powerful.

154
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,744
So the second question
really was, you know,

155
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:05,327
so we know that our minds
change our bodies,

156
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:09,744
but is it also true
that our bodies change our minds?

157
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:12,471
And when I say minds,
in the case of the powerful,

158
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:13,843
what am I talking about?

159
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:16,  9
So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings

160
00:08:16, 33 --> 00:08:19,605
and the sort of physiological things
that make up our thoughts and feelings,

161
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:22,672
and in my case, that's hormones.
I look at hormones.

162
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:27,  6
So what do the minds of the powerful
versus the powerless look like?

163
00:08:27, 30 --> 00:08:31,302
So powerful people tend to be,
not surprisingly,

164
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:35,526
more assertive and more confident,
more optimistic.

165
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,836
They actually feel they're going to win
even at games of chance.

166
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,704
They also tend to be able
to think more abstractly.

167
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:45,348
So there are a lot of differences.
They take more risks.

168
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:48,611
There are a lot of differences
between powerful and powerless people.

169
00:08:48,635 --> 00:08:51,455
Physiologically,
there also are differences

170
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:55,520
on two key hormones: testosterone,
which is the dominance hormone,

171
00:08:55,544 --> 00:08:59,214
and cortisol, which is the stress hormone.

172
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:06,359
So what we find is that high-power
alpha males in primate hierarchies

173
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:09,557
have high testosterone and low cortisol,

174
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:12,489
and powerful and effective leaders

175
00:09:13,107 --> 00:09:15,338
also have high testosterone
and low cortisol.

176
00:09:15,362 --> 00:09:17,743
So what does that mean?
When you think about power,

177
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:20, 66
people tended to think
only about testosterone,

178
00:09:20, 90 --> 00:09:21,854
because that was about dominance.

179
00:09:21,878 --> 00:09:25,324
But really, power is also about
how you react to stress.

180
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:28,453
So do you want the high-power
leader that's dominant,

181
00:09:28,477 --> 00:09:31,195
high on testosterone,
but really stress reactive?

182
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:32,760
Probably not, right?

183
00:09:32,784 --> 00:09:35,814
You want the person who's powerful
and assertive and dominant,

184
00:09:35,838 --> 00:09:39,502
but not very stress reactive,
the person who's laid back.

185
00:09:39,526 --> 00:09:44,652
So we know that in primate hierarchies,

186
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:47,744
if an alpha needs to take over,

187
00:09:47,768 --> 00:09:51,982
if an individual needs to take over
an alpha role sort of suddenly,

188
00:09:52,  6 --> 00:09:55, 93
within a few days,
that individual's testosterone has gone up

189
00:09:55,117 --> 00:09:58,598
significantly and his cortisol
has dropped significantly.

190
00:09:58,622 --> 00:10:01,639
So we have this evidence,
both that the body can shape

191
00:10:01,663 --> 00:10:04,  5
the mind, at least at the facial level,

192
00:10:04, 29 --> 00:10:08,134
and also that role changes
can shape the mind.

193
00:10:08,158 --> 00:10:10,916
So what happens, okay,
you take a role change,

194
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,500
what happens if you do that
at a really minimal level,

195
00:10:13,524 --> 00:10:15,953
like this tiny manipulation,
this tiny intervention?

196
00:10:15,977 --> 00:10:18,787
"For two minutes," you say,
"I want you to stand like this,

197
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:21,347
and it's going to make you feel
more powerful."

198
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,301
So this is what we did.

199
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:28,916
We decided to bring people into the lab
and run a little experiment,

200
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,465
and these people adopted, for two minutes,

201
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:35,949
either high-power poses
or low-power poses,

202
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:38,290
and I'm just going to show
you five of the poses,

203
00:10:38,314 --> 00:10:39,875
although they took on only two.

204
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,379
So here's one.

205
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:43,918
A couple more.

206
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:49,365
This one has been dubbed
the "Wonder Woman" by the media.

207
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:50,764
Here are a couple more.

208
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:53,118
So you can be standing
or you can be sitting.

209
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:55,103
And here are the low-power poses.

210
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:57,857
So you're folding up,
you're making yourself small.

211
00:10:59,464 --> 00:11:00,905
This one is very low-power.

212
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:04,888
When you're touching your neck,
you're really protecting yourself.

213
00:11:04,912 --> 00:11:06,909
So this is what happens.

214
00:11:07, 27 --> 00:11:09,233
They come in, they spit into a vial,

215
00:11:09,257 --> 00:11:12,406
for two minutes, we say,
"You need to do this or this."

216
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,471
They don't look at pictures of the poses.

217
00:11:14,495 --> 00:11:17, 22
We don't want to prime them
with a concept of power.

218
00:11:17, 46 --> 00:11:18,679
We want them to be feeling power.

219
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:20, 38
So two minutes they do this.

220
00:11:20, 62 --> 00:11:23,247
We then ask them, "How powerful
do you feel?" on a series of items,

221
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:25,614
and then we give them
an opportunity to gamble,

222
00:11:25,638 --> 00:11:28,379
and then we take another saliva sample.

223
00:11:28,403 --> 00:11:30,261
That's it. That's the whole experiment.

224
00:11:30,285 --> 00:11:31,846
So this is what we find.

225
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,750
Risk tolerance, which is the gambling,

226
00:11:33,774 --> 00:11:37,888
we find that when you are
in the high-power pose condition,

227
00:11:37,912 --> 00:11:40, 46
86 percent of you will gamble.

228
00:11:40, 70 --> 00:11:42,166
When you're in the low-power
pose condition,

229
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,166
only 60 percent, and that's
a whopping significant difference.

230
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,646
Here's what we find on testosterone.

231
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,183
From their baseline when they come in,

232
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:54,513
high-power people experience
about a 20-percent increase,

233
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:59,134
and low-power people experience
about a 10-percent decrease.

234
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:01,951
So again, two minutes,
and you get these changes.

235
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:03,952
Here's what you get on cortisol.

236
00:12:03,976 --> 00:12:07,750
High-power people experience
about a 25-percent decrease,

237
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:11,882
and the low-power people experience
about a 15-percent increase.

238
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:14,614
So two minutes lead
to these hormonal changes

239
00:12:14,638 --> 00:12:16,258
that configure your brain

240
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:20,559
to basically be either assertive,
confident and comfortable,

241
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:25,636
or really stress-reactive,
and feeling sort of shut down.

242
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,423
And we've all had the feeling, right?

243
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:33,631
So it seems that our nonverbals do govern
how we think and feel about ourselves,

244
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:36, 87
so it's not just others,
but it's also ourselves.

245
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:38,514
Also, our bodies change our minds.

246
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:40,920
But the next question, of course,

247
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:42,764
is, can power posing for a few minutes

248
00:12:42,788 --> 00:12:44,825
really change your life
in meaningful ways?

249
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:49,142
This is in the lab, it's this little task,
it's just a couple of minutes.

250
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,907
Where can you actually apply this?

251
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:52,742
Which we cared about, of course.

252
00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:59,507
And so we think where you want to use this
is evaluative situations,

253
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:01,984
like social threat situations.

254
00:13:02,  8 --> 00:13:04,564
Where are you being evaluated,
either by your friends?

255
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:06,645
For teenagers,
it's at the lunchroom table.

256
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:10,942
For some people it's speaking
at a school board meeting.

257
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:14,730
It might be giving a pitch
or giving a talk like this

258
00:13:14,754 --> 00:13:17,528
or doing a job interview.

259
00:13:17,552 --> 00:13:20,220
We decided that the one
that most people could relate to

260
00:13:20,244 --> 00:13:23,139
because most people had been through,
was the job interview.

261
00:13:23,163 --> 00:13:25,894
So we published these findings,

262
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,479
and the media are all over it,

263
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:29,578
and they say, Okay, so this is what you do

264
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:31,675
when you go in
for the job interview, right?

265
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:32,706
(Laughter)

266
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,177
You know, so we were of course
horrified, and said,

267
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:37,473
Oh my God, no,
that's not what we meant at all.

268
00:13:37,497 --> 00:13:39,737
For numerous reasons, no, don't do that.

269
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:42,328
Again, this is not about you
talking to other people.

270
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:43,913
It's you talking to yourself.

271
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:46,996
What do you do before you go
into a job interview? You do this.

272
00:13:47, 20 --> 00:13:49,562
You're sitting down.
You're looking at your iPhone --

273
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:51,848
or your Android, not trying
to leave anyone out.

274
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,742
You're looking at your notes,

275
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,766
you're hunching up, making yourself small,

276
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,219
when really what you should
be doing maybe is this,

277
00:13:58,243 --> 00:14:01,280
like, in the bathroom, right?
Do that. Find two minutes.

278
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:03, 66
So that's what we want to test. Okay?

279
00:14:03, 90 --> 00:14:04,884
So we bring people into a lab,

280
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:08,261
and they do either high-
or low-power poses again,

281
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:10,893
they go through
a very stressful job interview.

282
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:14,509
It's five minutes long.
They are being recorded.

283
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:16,490
They're being judged also,

284
00:14:16,514 --> 00:14:20,995
and the judges are trained
to give no nonverbal feedback,

285
00:14:21, 19 --> 00:14:22,578
so they look like this.

286
00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:24,886
Imagine this is the person
interviewing you.

287
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,509
So for five minutes, nothing,
and this is worse than being heckled.

288
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,173
People hate this.

289
00:14:31,197 --> 00:14:34,913
It's what Marianne LaFrance calls
"standing in social quicksand."

290
00:14:34,937 --> 00:14:36,722
So this really spikes your cortisol.

291
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:39, 32
So this is the job interview
we put them through,

292
00:14:39, 56 --> 00:14:41,253
because we really wanted
to see what happened.

293
00:14:41,277 --> 00:14:44,360
We then have these coders look
at these tapes, four of them.

294
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,532
They're blind to the hypothesis.
They're blind to the conditions.

295
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:50,317
They have no idea
who's been posing in what pose,

296
00:14:50,341 --> 00:14:55,407
and they end up looking
at these sets of tapes,

297
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:57,579
and they say,
"We want to hire these people,"

298
00:14:57,603 --> 00:14:59,104
all the high-power posers.

299
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:00,901
"We don't want to hire these people.

300
00:15:00,925 --> 00:15:04,742
We also evaluate these people
much more positively overall."

301
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:06,406
But what's driving it?

302
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,422
It's not about the content of the speech.

303
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:11,298
It's about the presence
that they're bringing to the speech.

304
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:13,799
Because we rate them
on all these variables

305
00:15:13,823 --> 00:15:17,362
related to competence,
like, how well-structured is the speech?

306
00:15:17,386 --> 00:15:19,620
How good is it?
What are their qualifications?

307
00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:22,270
No effect on those things.
This is what's affected.

308
00:15:22,294 --> 00:15:23,993
These kinds of things.

309
00:15:24, 17 --> 00:15:26,408
People are bringing
their true selves, basically.

310
00:15:26,432 --> 00:15:27,822
They're bringing themselves.

311
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:29,945
They bring their ideas, but as themselves,

312
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:32,181
with no, you know, residue over them.

313
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:37,112
So this is what's driving the effect,
or mediating the effect.

314
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,480
So when I tell people about this,

315
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:43,859
that our bodies change our minds
and our minds can change our behavior,

316
00:15:43,883 --> 00:15:46,635
and our behavior can change
our outcomes, they say to me,

317
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:48,202
"It feels fake." Right?

318
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:50,104
So I said, fake it till you make it.

319
00:15:50,128 --> 00:15:51,981
It's not me.

320
00:15:52,  5 --> 00:15:55,156
I don't want to get there
and then still feel like a fraud.

321
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,990
I don't want to feel like an impostor.

322
00:15:57, 14 --> 00:16:01, 87
I don't want to get there only to feel
like I'm not supposed to be here.

323
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:03,274
And that really resonated with me,

324
00:16:03,298 --> 00:16:06,520
because I want to tell you
a little story about being an impostor

325
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:08,742
and feeling like
I'm not supposed to be here.

326
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:11,683
When I was 19, I was
in a really bad car accident.

327
00:16:11,707 --> 00:16:15, 88
I was thrown out of a car,
rolled several times.

328
00:16:15,112 --> 00:16:16,970
I was thrown from the car.

329
00:16:16,994 --> 00:16:19,958
And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward,

330
00:16:19,982 --> 00:16:22,191
and I had been withdrawn from college,

331
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:27,903
and I learned that my I.Q. had dropped
by two standard deviations,

332
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:30,491
which was very traumatic.

333
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:33,362
I knew my I.Q. because
I had identified with being smart,

334
00:16:33,386 --> 00:16:35,374
and I had been called gifted as a child.

335
00:16:35,398 --> 00:16:38,574
So I'm taken out of college,
I keep trying to go back.

336
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,798
They say, "You're not going
to finish college.

337
00:16:40,822 --> 00:16:43,375
Just, you know, there are other
things for you to do,

338
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:45,399
but that's not going to work out for you."

339
00:16:45,423 --> 00:16:48,957
So I really struggled
with this, and I have to say,

340
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:51,731
having your identity taken
from you, your core identity,

341
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:53,590
and for me it was being smart,

342
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:55,253
having that taken from you,

343
00:16:55,277 --> 00:16:58,376
there's nothing that leaves you feeling
more powerless than that.

344
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,179
So I felt entirely powerless.

345
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:02, 65
I worked and worked, and I got lucky,

346
00:17:02, 89 --> 00:17:03,935
and worked, and got lucky, and worked.

347
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,187
Eventually I graduated from college.

348
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:08,211
It took me four years
longer than my peers,

349
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:12,552
and I convinced someone,
my angel advisor, Susan Fiske,

350
00:17:12,576 --> 00:17:15,496
to take me on,
and so I ended up at Princeton,

351
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,347
and I was like,
I am not supposed to be here.

352
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,641
I am an impostor.

353
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,570
And the night before my first-year talk,

354
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:25, 93
and the first-year talk at Princeton
is a 20-minute talk to 20 people.

355
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:26,295
That's it.

356
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,782
I was so afraid of being
found out the next day

357
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:31,595
that I called her
and said, "I'm quitting."

358
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:33,451
She was like, "You are not quitting,

359
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:36,  9
because I took a gamble
on you, and you're staying.

360
00:17:36, 33 --> 00:17:38,800
You're going to stay, and this is
what you're going to do.

361
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,157
You are going to fake it.

362
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:43,337
You're going to do every talk
that you ever get asked to do.

363
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:45,600
You're just going to do it
and do it and do it,

364
00:17:45,624 --> 00:17:48, 45
even if you're terrified
and just paralyzed

365
00:17:48, 69 --> 00:17:50,418
and having an out-of-body experience,

366
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:53,788
until you have this moment where you say,
'Oh my gosh, I'm doing it.

367
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:56,754
Like, I have become this.
I am actually doing this.'"

368
00:17:56,778 --> 00:17:57,873
So that's what I did.

369
00:17:57,897 --> 00:17:59,281
Five years in grad school,

370
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:01,405
a few years, you know,
I'm at Northwestern,

371
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:03,492
I moved to Harvard, I'm at Harvard,

372
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:07,492
I'm not really thinking about it anymore,
but for a long time I had been thinking,

373
00:18:07,516 --> 00:18:09,298
"Not supposed to be here."

374
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:12, 15
So at the end of my first year at Harvard,

375
00:18:12, 39 --> 00:18:16,340
a student who had not talked
in class the entire semester,

376
00:18:16,364 --> 00:18:20, 31
who I had said, "Look, you've gotta
participate or else you're going to fail,"

377
00:18:20, 55 --> 00:18:22,579
came into my office.
I really didn't know her at all.

378
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:26, 31
She came in totally defeated,
and she said,

379
00:18:26, 55 --> 00:18:29,181
"I'm not supposed to be here."

380
00:18:32,931 --> 00:18:34,888
And that was the moment for me.

381
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:36,504
Because two things happened.

382
00:18:36,528 --> 00:18:37,798
One was that I realized,

383
00:18:37,822 --> 00:18:40,932
oh my gosh,
I don't feel like that anymore.

384
00:18:40,956 --> 00:18:43,956
I don't feel that anymore,
but she does, and I get that feeling.

385
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,251
And the second was,
she is supposed to be here!

386
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:48,228
Like, she can fake it, she can become it.

387
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,795
So I was like, "Yes, you are!
You are supposed to be here!

388
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:53,581
And tomorrow you're going to fake it,

389
00:18:53,605 --> 00:18:56,294
you're going to make yourself
powerful, and, you know --

390
00:18:56,318 --> 00:19:01,711
(Applause)

391
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:05,789
"And you're going to go
into the classroom,

392
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:08,213
and you are going to give
the best comment ever."

393
00:19:08,237 --> 00:19:11,218
You know? And she gave
the best comment ever,

394
00:19:11,242 --> 00:19:13,181
And people turned around and were like,

395
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:16,125
oh my God, I didn't even notice her
sitting there. (Laughter)

396
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:17,942
She comes back to me months later,

397
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:21,  6
and I realized that she had not just
faked it till she made it,

398
00:19:21, 30 --> 00:19:23,404
she had actually faked it
till she became it.

399
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,227
So she had changed.

400
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:29,311
And so I want to say to you,
don't fake it till you make it.

401
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,108
Fake it till you become it.

402
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:35,749
Do it enough until you actually
become it and internalize.

403
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:38,404
The last thing I'm going
to leave you with is this.

404
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:42,876
Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes.

405
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,373
So, this is two minutes.

406
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:47,207
Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.

407
00:19:47,231 --> 00:19:50,355
Before you go into the next stressful
evaluative situation,

408
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:53, 61
for two minutes, try doing this,
in the elevator,

409
00:19:53, 85 --> 00:19:56,300
in a bathroom stall, at your desk
behind closed doors.

410
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:57,727
That's what you want to do.

411
00:19:57,751 --> 00:20:00,562
Configure your brain
to cope the best in that situation.

412
00:20:00,586 --> 00:20:03,527
Get your testosterone up.
Get your cortisol down.

413
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:07,493
Don't leave that situation feeling
like, oh, I didn't show them who I am.

414
00:20:07,517 --> 00:20:09,217
Leave that situation feeling like,

415
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:12,213
I really feel like I got to say
who I am and show who I am.

416
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:18,  4
So I want to ask you first, you know,
both to try power posing,

417
00:20:18, 28 --> 00:20:23,118
and also I want to ask you to share
the science, because this is simple.

418
00:20:23,142 --> 00:20:25,295
I don't have ego involved in this.
(Laughter)

419
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:27, 82
Give it away. Share it with people,

420
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:29,526
because the people who can use it the most

421
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,901
are the ones with no resources
and no technology

422
00:20:32,925 --> 00:20:35, 99
and no status and no power.

423
00:20:35,123 --> 00:20:37,671
Give it to them
because they can do it in private.

424
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,139
They need their bodies,
privacy and two minutes,

425
00:20:40,163 --> 00:20:43,289
and it can significantly change
the outcomes of their life.

426
00:20:43,313 --> 00:20:44,444
Thank you.

427
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:47,499
(Applause)
